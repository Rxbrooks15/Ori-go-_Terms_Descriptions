# Ori-go-_Terms_Descriptions

The Ori(go) "Gami model" is based on a regression model (BERT + log) meant to quantify origami value. The Gami model utilizes CDSP heuristics based on model complexity , difficulty (factoring how long the model took; fold time), symmetry (how flat and symmetrical the model looks), and perplexity components (the external public interpretation of an origami from crowdsourced data) to catergorize a plethora of models.
